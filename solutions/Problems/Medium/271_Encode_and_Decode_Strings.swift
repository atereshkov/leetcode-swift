 Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.

 Please implement encode and decode.

 Example 1:
 Input: ["lint","code","love","you"]
 Output:["lint","code","love","you"]
 Explanation: One possible encode method is: "leet:;code:;love:;you"

 Example 2:
 Input: ["we","say",":","yes"]
 Output: ["we","say",":","yes"]

 Constraints:
 0 <= strs.length < 100
 0 <= strs[i].length < 200
 strs[i] contains only UTF-8 characters.

import Foundation

func encodeStr(_ strs: [String]) -> String {
    return ""
}

func decodeStr(_ string: String) -> [String] {
    return []
}
